## Project-Specific Context

This is the **DECLuTTER-AI** repository. It is ADHD-friendly decluttering assistant. Snap a photo, get grouped items, make keep/donate/trash decisions in a 10-min sprint. Flutter + FastAPI..

# KyaniteLabs Engineering Rules

This file provides operating instructions for all AI coding agents working in KyaniteLabs repositories. It is the AGENTS.md mirror of CLAUDE.md — both files contain identical rules.

## Organization Principles

- **Local-first when it matters** — keep data, creative work, and knowledge close to the people who own it
- **Useful over flashy** — solve real workflow problems
- **Human-in-the-loop by design** — AI accelerates judgment, it doesn't erase it
- **Open where it helps** — public projects are documented for discovery and reuse
- **Craft matters** — README quality, tests, and maintenance are part of the product

## Issue-Driven Development

All contributions to KyaniteLabs repos flow through GitHub issues.

### Workflow

```
External contributor opens issue
  → Template applies: bug/enhancement + needs-triage label
  → Maintainer reviews, adds: approved label
  → Auto-triage promotes to: agent-ready label
  → Pipeline picks up → creates fix PR

Owner/member (Pastorsimon1798) opens issue
  → Auto-triage detects member author
  → Promotes directly to agent-ready (skips triage)
  → Pipeline picks up → creates fix PR
```

### Label System

| Label | Meaning | Who sets it |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `needs-triage` | New issue, awaiting review | Issue template (auto) |
| `approved` | Maintainer approved for work | Maintainer (manual) |
| `agent-ready` | Ready for pipeline to pick up | Auto-triage (auto) |
| `bug` | Bug report | Issue template (auto) |
| `enhancement` | Feature request | Issue template (auto) |
| `repo-pipeline` | Created by pipeline scanner | Pipeline (auto) |
| `ci-failure` | CI broke on main branch | Pipeline (auto) |
| `severity:low/medium/high/critical` | Impact level | Pipeline (auto) |

### Rules for Agents Creating Issues

- Never create issues without the `repo-pipeline` label
- Always include reproduction steps or evidence
- Set severity based on: does it break main? does it affect users? is it cosmetic?
- Link to the relevant CI run, commit, or file

## Pipeline Awareness

The GITHUB_pipeline runs a triage cycle every 30 minutes. When working in KyaniteLabs repos, be aware:

1. **Your PRs will be monitored** by `pr-maintainer.py` — it fixes CI failures, rebases, and addresses review comments
2. **Do not delete `fix/issue-*` branches** — the pipeline manages these
3. **Pipeline-created issues** have the `repo-pipeline` label — treat them as real issues
4. **Circuit breaker** — if the pipeline enters RED state, all automated work stops until manually reset
5. **Issue priority** — pipeline sorts by severity (critical > high > medium > low), then by age

## CI Standards

All KyaniteLabs repos must have these CI checks (via GitHub Actions on Blacksmith runners):

### Required Checks (must pass before merge)

| Check | Tool | Config |
|-------|------|--------|
| Lint | ruff | `ruff check . && ruff format --check .` |
| Test | pytest | `pytest --tb=short -q` |
| Build | pip install | `pip install -e .` (Python) or equivalent |

### Recommended Checks (add when applicable)

| Check | Tool | When |
|-------|------|------|
| Security scan | bandit + pip-audit | Python repos |
| Type check | mypy | repos with type annotations |
| Docker build | docker build | repos with Dockerfile |
| Package surface | custom script | published packages |
| Compatibility matrix | multi-Python/Node | public packages |

### CI Rules

- All CI runs on `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2404` runners
- CI must pass on all supported Python/Node versions
- Never skip CI (`--no-verify`) — if it fails, fix the root cause
- CI failures on main get auto-detected by the pipeline

## Branch Protection

All `main`/`master` branches in KyaniteLabs repos are protected:

- No direct pushes — everything through PRs
- Required status checks must pass
- Branches must be up-to-date before merge
- Force pushes blocked
- Linear history required (squash or rebase merge)

## Repository Standards

### Python Repos
- **Formatter**: ruff (not black)
- **Linter**: ruff
- **Config**: `pyproject.toml` (not setup.py/setup.cfg)
- **Python**: minimum 3.11, test on 3.11 and latest
- **Dependencies**: pin exact versions

### Node/TypeScript Repos
- **Package manager**: pnpm (not npm/yarn)
- **Formatter**: prettier
- **Linter**: eslint

### All Repos
- **README.md**: Must explain what it is, how to run it, how to test it
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Updated with every release
- **LICENSE**: MIT (org default)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Points to org contributing guide

## Agent Coordination

When multiple agents work on the same repo:

1. **Claim your scope** — note in the issue which files/areas you're working on
2. **Don't edit files another agent is actively modifying** — check open PRs first
3. **Rebase frequently** — pull from main before pushing to avoid conflicts
4. **Test before pushing** — run the same CI checks locally first
5. **Communicate via issues** — leave comments on issues for context, not in code

## Code Quality Rules

### Dependency Discipline
- Never add a dependency for something 20 lines of stdlib can do
- Never add a dependency without checking it's actively maintained (commits in last 6 months)
- Pin exact versions in requirements, never ranges
- When you add one, write a one-line comment explaining why

### Error Handling
- Validate at system edges only (user input, API responses, file reads)
- Trust internal code — no try/except around your own functions unless the operation is genuinely fallible (network, disk)
- Never catch `Exception` broadly — catch the specific failure mode
- Errors must be actionable: tell the human *what* broke and *what to do*

### No Orphaned Code
- Every function must be called by something (tests count)
- Every file must be imported by something
- No dead config, no unused imports, no commented-out code blocks
- If you write it, wire it up or delete it

### Security Non-Negotiables
- Never use `shell=True` with user input
- Never hardcode secrets, tokens, or API keys
- Always validate file paths (no path traversal)
- Always use parameterized queries for database interaction
- Always use HTTPS for external calls
- Sanitize any string that becomes part of a command, HTML, or SQL

### Testing
- Test behavior, not implementation
- One assertion per concept
- Test the unhappy path — what happens when the API is down, the file is missing, the input is garbage
- Integration tests over unit tests for anything touching external systems
- No mocking what you don't own unless the real thing is destructive or slow

### Documentation
- README must answer: what is this, how do I run it, how do I test it
- Public functions get a docstring only if the name doesn't explain itself
- No docstrings on private functions — rename them instead
- CHANGELOG entries for every user-visible change

### Git and PR Hygiene
- Commits tell *why*, not *what* (the diff shows what)
- PRs under 400 lines of meaningful change
- Every PR describes how it was verified
- No merge commits on feature branches — rebase

### Performance
- No N+1 queries
- No loading full datasets into memory — paginate or stream
- No regex in hot loops
- If you add a cache, also add a cache invalidation strategy

### Configuration
- Magic numbers become named constants
- Tunable behavior becomes config/env vars, not code changes
- Default config works for development without modification

## KyaniteLabs Tech Stack Standard

Every project in KyaniteLabs follows these stack decisions. No exceptions without explicit approval.

### TypeScript Projects
- **Zero `.js`/`.jsx` files.** Everything is `.ts`/`.tsx`. If a file is JS, convert it.
- **`tsconfig.json`: `strict: true`, `target: ES2022`, `module: NodeNext`.** No `any` without a justifying comment.
- **Package manager: pnpm.** Never npm, never yarn. If a repo uses npm, migrate it.
- **Formatter: prettier.** Linter: eslint with typescript-eslint. Both configured from day one.
- **Test: vitest.** Not jest.
- **Build: tsup** for libraries, **tsc** for applications.
- **Import style: ESM only.** `"type": "module"` in package.json. No CommonJS (`require`, `module.exports`).

### Python Projects
- **Python 3.11 minimum.** Test on 3.11 and latest.
- **Config: `pyproject.toml` only.** No setup.py, no setup.cfg, no requirements.txt. Dependencies go in `[project.dependencies]`.
- **Build backend: hatch.** Not setuptools.
- **Formatter: ruff format.** Linter: ruff. Not black, not flake8, not isort.
- **Test: pytest** with `--tb=short`.
- **Entry points: `[project.scripts]`** in pyproject.toml, not `if __name__ == "__main__"`.

### Dart/Flutter Projects
- **Dart only.** No embedded JS unless Flutter requires it.
- **Package manager: pub.**
- **Test: flutter_test.** Lint: `flutter analyze`.

### Cross-Cutting Rules
- **One language per project.** No Python+JS repos, no TS+JS mixing.
- **One package manager per project.**
- **Dependencies pinned to exact versions.**
- **Editorconfig** in every repo root for consistent indentation.

## Project Scaffolding

When Kyan (operations agent) receives a project idea via Telegram:

### Phase 1: Research
1. Find latest official documentation for the relevant framework/library
2. Check latest stable versions — pin all dependencies exactly
3. Check GitHub Advisories for security issues in chosen dependencies
4. Check community best practices (recent posts, discussions)
5. Check if an existing KyaniteLabs repo solves a similar problem

### Phase 2: Classify
Determine project type and apply matching tech stack from the rules above.

### Phase 3: Scaffold
Create a private repo in Pastorsimon1798's personal account with:

**Every project gets:**
- `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `LICENSE` (MIT)
- `README.md` (what, why, run, test), `CHANGELOG.md`
- `CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md` (from org templates + project-specific)
- `.cursorrules` + `.windsurfrules` (from org templates)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `dependabot.yml`, `CODEOWNERS`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint + test + build, Blacksmith runner, concurrency, caching)
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug_report.yml, feature_request.yml, config.yml)

**Python additionally:** pyproject.toml (hatch), src/project_name/__init__.py, tests/test_smoke.py
**TypeScript additionally:** package.json (type:module), tsconfig.json (strict), eslint.config.js, .prettierrc, vitest.config.ts, src/index.ts

### Phase 4: Verify
- Initial commit + push
- Branch protection on main
- CI runs green
- Parity check (CLAUDE.md = AGENTS.md)
- Report to user: repo URL, stack, CI status

## Local-First Inference (LM Studio)

All KyaniteLabs projects that require an LLM must use local inference first. Server runs on Tailscale at `100.66.225.85:1234`.

### Server Specs
- **CPU**: AMD Ryzen AI Max 395 (Strix Halo) — 16 cores, 32 threads
- **Memory**: 96GB unified RAM, 48GB VRAM (shared pool)

### API Quick Reference
| Action | Method | Endpoint | Body |
|--------|--------|----------|------|
| List loaded models | GET | `/v1/models` | — |
| Load a model | POST | `/api/v1/models/load` | `{"model": "<key>"}` |
| Unload a model | POST | `/api/v1/models/unload` | `{"instance_id": "<key>"}` |
| Chat completion | POST | `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible |

### Loading Rules
1. **Check before loading** — call `GET /v1/models` first, reuse if already loaded
2. **Do not touch models you did not load** — other agents or processes depend on them
3. **Unload when done** — call unload endpoint after task completes
4. **No downloading** — only use models already on the server
5. **Always enable**: flash attention, KV cache quantization at Q8, full GPU offload
6. **CPU thread pool: 10 threads** (formula: 16 cores × 0.625)
7. **Memory budget**: keep 16GB free, max ~80GB for LLM usage

### Inference Sampling Profiles
| Profile | Temp | top_p | top_k | repeat_penalty | min_p |
|---------|------|-------|-------|----------------|-------|
| Coding | 0.0-0.1 | 0.95 | 40 | 1.0 | 0.05 |
| Reasoning | 0.6-0.7 | 0.9 | 40 | 1.1 | 0.05 |
| Creative | 0.8 | 0.92 | 45 | 1.05 | 0.04 |
| Deterministic | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1 | 1.0 | 0.0 |
